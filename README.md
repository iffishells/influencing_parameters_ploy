# Influencing Parameters

This project addresses a regression problem that has been tackled using multiple models, including both machine learning and deep learning approaches.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Non-linear Regression Model:** Utilizes non-linear relationships between input and output variables.
- **Random Forest Model:** Ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting Model:** Builds a series of weak learners to create a strong predictive model.
- **Support Vector Machine with Different Kernels:** Utilizes Support Vector Machines with various kernel functions for effective regression.

## Deep Learning Model

- **Simple Neural Network:** Basic neural network architecture for regression tasks.


## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now, you have set up the virtual environment with the necessary dependencies to run the project.
